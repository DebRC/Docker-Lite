# Microspace - Replica of Docker
Microspace is a lightweight container orchestration tool designed to replicate Docker functionalities for manual container creation with namespaces and cgroups. It provides developers with a simple yet powerful alternative to Docker, enabling them to deploy microservices efficiently in isolated environments.

Note: <i>conductor.sh can create only Debian container images. Can be changed by replacing debootstrap with proper commands.</i>
